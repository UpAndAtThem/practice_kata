# OOP BENEFITS

Object Oriented programming is useful because it creates encapsulated objects that have their own scope where the code runs uninpeded from the rest of the program. It creates a polymorphic interface which helps when you want the same interface for differing objects producing a different outcome.  

Its easier to scale because instead of one big piece of code running, you have standalone objects that can be expanded and refactored without causing a huge butterfly effect in the codebase. Plus object orient programming allows programmers to think about code in an abstract way, with nouns acting as classes, and verbs being the classes behavior.

---------------------------------------------------

# CLASS

Classes act as a blueprint or a basic outline for objects. Classes are encapsulated code with public interfaces that acts as an abstraction of real world objects (IE: Person class, Box class, Dice class, etc) A class defines, and encapsulates an objects state and behavior. State tracks attributes, and is created at the object level, whereas behavior is what an object is capable of doing, and is shared at the class level. Instantiated objects of a class all share the behaviors defined by the class. Instance variables a.k.a. 'an objects state' are not shared, it's only available to the specific instantiated object in which the variable was created, and is how different objects of the same class can hold different states from one another.

-------------------------------------------------------------

# OBJECTS

objects are instantiations of a class.  A class is what defines an object.  Objects have state and behavior. State, or an objects attributes are created at the object level and are unique to each individual instance. Behaviors are shared at the class level, by all instances of the class.

------------------------------------------------------------

# ENCAPSULATION

Hiding functionality and state from outside code. Effectively keeping the code safe from outside interference, by controling the access to the encapsulated code, only exposing publically the interfaces that which are needed to properly interact with the object itself. You can set public, private, and protected methods for a class, It will help you control access levels, which will affect the interface of how instantiated objects can interact with its internals.

instantiated objects do not have access to protected methods outside the class definition, but is treated like a public method from within the class definition. 

instantiated objects never have access to private methods outside or inside the class. private methods are only accessible from other methods in the class. private methods cannot be invoked with an explicit calling object (EX self.private_method or mcgruff.private_method) 

public methods are available anywhere, no access control is enforced. Public methods are the interfaces objects use externally, all methods are public by default unless it follows the keyword private or protected.

class Person
  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  private

  attr_reader :age, :name

  public

  def greeting
    puts "Hello my name is #{name}, I am #{age} years old" 
  end
end

rick = Person.new("Rick", 33)

because of the private keyword, the getter methods name and age are only accessable within methods that are a part of the same class, and cannot be invoked by an explict calling object.

rick.greeting can access the name and age private instance methods because it's being invoked within the method definition without being invoked by the instantiated Person (self keyword) calling object.

rick.age cannot access instance getter method age and name because it is private, It would trigger a NoMethodError exception.

The Person class is an example of encapsulation.  The state and behavior is wrapped up within the class definition and the only things that have access to that code are instantiated objects of the same class or from within other methods of the same class.

----------------------------------------------------------

# INHERITANCE

Inheritance is behaviors inherited from a superclass to all of its subclasses.  A way to achieve polymorphism as well as resusing code that shares common behavior among the inheritance structure. Through inheritance, you can extract shared behavior of multiple classes into a superclass, and have those classes inherit from the superclass containing the shared behaviors. This in turn allows you forego the need for repetion of code.  Behavior from superclasses are inherited by all subclasses, but not the other way around. Superclasses inherit nothing from its subclasses. In order to subclass the symbol < is used after the class name in the definition followed by the superclass that particular class is subclassing.

module Swimmable
  def swim
    puts "Swim swim swim..."
  end
end

class Animal

end

class Fish < Animal
  include Swimmable
end

class Mammal < Animal

end

class Dog < Mammal
  include Swimmable
end

class Cat < Mammal

end


Dog.new.swim
Fish.new.swim
Cat.new.swim 

----------------------------------------------------

# MODULES

A module allows us to group reusable code into one place. We can use modules in our classes by using the include keyword, followed by the module name. This will extend the modules behaviors to the class that included it. Modules are also used as a namespace to group objects together. The Math module is a good example of modules used as a namespace.


module Swimmable
  def swim
    puts "I'm swimming"
  end

  def dive
    puts "I'm diving"
  end
end

class Person
  include Swimmable
end

Person.new.dive

-----------------------------------------------------

# NAMESPACING MODULE

Modules can also be used as a namespace to group classes together. This safegaurds the code against class collision with the codebase, because for instantiation it requires accessing the class through the module with double colons :: (EX. ModuleName::ClassName), making the instantiation call more explicit and clear. 
Below is an example on how to use modules for namespacing

module Dogs
  class Terrier

  end

  class BullDog

  end

  class BassetHound

  end
end

terry_instance = Dogs::Terrier.new

-----------------------------------------------------

# INHERITANCE VS MODULES

use inheritance if its an "is a" relationship. Use modules if its a "has an ability" relationship.  For instance choose inheritance for hierachical relationships. ex: Beagle inherits from Mammal which inherits from Animal.

use modules for behaviors or abilities. ex: the ability to fly would use the flyable module. modules are a collection of behaviors that can be mixed into multiple classes, unlike inheritance, classes can mixin as many modules they need, where as a class can only subclass from one class.  modules acts similarly to inheritance, but modules cannot be instantiated like a class can.

In the above code, the classes Fish and Mammal both subclass from Animal, again, because it has an "is a" relationship (A fish and a mammal are animals). We also want to reuse the swim functionality without having to put the same code into 2, 3, 4 or however many classes we need to grant the ability to swim. swim wont fit into Mammal or Animal classes because not all of their subclasses share that behavior. In order to solve this we need to use a module. The module Swimmable is created, and mixed in to the Dog and Fish classes with the keyword include followed by the module name, this will now give those classes that shared behavior.

------------------------------------------------------

# POLYMORPHISM

Polymorphism is the ability to have the same interface with different objects, getting different results.  Rubys class encapsulation creates a scope where objects can have their own version of a commonly named method that other classes use. Also, method overriding in hierarchical relationships allows rubists to achieve polymorphism, in which a subclass overrides a superclasses method, creating a unique implementation of that method to that class.

class Mammal
  def speak
    puts "Hey, I'm a Mammal"
  end
end

class Person < Mammal
  def speak
    puts "Hey, I'm a person!"
  end
end 

class Dog < Mammal
  def speak
    puts "Hey, I'm a dog! WOOF! WOOF!"
  end
end

Dog.new.speak
Person.new.speak

speak is an instance method of both Mammal, Person, and Dog class. Being ruby's look up path for speak the two will never have overriding issues because they are not in the same hierarcical structure. speak is defined within both classes, so when ruby first looks within the calling objects class for the method, it will invoke the first match it comes across. This is how polymorphism is achieved.

Person and Dog both subclass from Mammal.  Mammal inherits to both classes the behavior speak.  However both of those classes Person and Dog use method overriding to create their own implementation of the speak instance method, and will never access Mammal#speak so long as they have their own implementaions.

-------------------------------------------------------

# METHOD LOOKUP PATH

method look up path is the path ruby takes when trying to do method resolution.  Ruby first looks within the class that the calling object belongs to. Ruby will then look through all of the mixed in modules in reverse order from which they were included. Ruby will then use inheritance, checking the superclass of the calling object, followed by the superclasses modules, again in reverse order of inclusion. Ruby will then Check The superclasses superclass, then the modules, until it reaches the BasicObject class. It looks through BasicObject's methods then modules. If at this point there is no resolution, ruby was unable to find the method it was searching for, and will throw a NoMethodError exception and crash the program.

To check for the method lookup path of a class you can use the class method 'ancestors'

In the above code the Method lookup path of a Fish object would be Fish, Swimmable, Animal, Object, Kernel, BasicObject

-------------------------------------------------------


# INSTANCE METHODS

instance methods are methods that are called on an instance of a class.  Its the public interface an object uses to expose its state, or invoke its defined behaviors.    

class Dog
  def speak
    puts 'Woof Woof'
  end
end

doggie = Dog.new
doggie.speak 

speak is an instance method that an instantiated Dog object, being pointed at by the variable doggie, is invoking.

-----------------------------------------------------------

# ATTR_METHODS

attr_reader, attr_writer, and attr_accessor are methods used to create getter and setter methods.
They take as arguments 1 or more symbols of the instance variable name you want to create getter and or setter methods.

the line of code below is the same as defining both of the following instance methods.

attr_accessor :name

the code above is the same as the code below

def name=(name) setter method
  @name = name
end

def name getter method
  @name
end

if you only want to define the getter method use 'attr_reader'
if you only want to define the setter method use 'attr_writer'
if you want to define both the getter and setter method use 'attr_accessor'

-----------------------------------------------------------

# SELF

self can mean a couple things in Ruby.  If the keyword self is used within the definition of an instance method, self refers to the calling object of the method.  

When self is used to define a class method, or used within a class method, self is still referring to the calling object, which in this case is the class itself.

class Person
  def self.greeting
    puts "This 'self' is the #{self} class"
  end

  def greeting
    puts "This 'self' is #{self} a Person instance"
  end
end

cindy = Person.new

Person.greeting
cindy.greeting

------------------------------------------------------------

# SUPER

The keyword super invoked from within a method allows us to look up the hierarchical structure for another instance of the method currently being executed. When it finds the method, it executes it and returns the return value back to super.  If you invoke super with no arguments it will automatically pass all of the arguments that were supplied to the current method being executed.  If you invoke super as super() it is passed no arguments.  You can pass as many or as few as needed to avoid an ArgumentError exception.

class Animal
  def initialize
    @type = 'Animal'
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
  def initialize(name)
    super()
    @name = name
  end
end

sparky = Dog.new('Sparky')

in Dog#initialize super is invoked with no argument.  Looks and finds initialize in its superclass, the Animal class. Runs the code and creates the instance variable @type containing the string Animal.  Implicitly returning the string 'Animal' as super's return back to the Dog#initialize method (which the program does nothing with).  After which the rest of the code is run, setting the instance variable @name to the value of the provided name argument.

---------------------------------------------------------

# EQUALITY

By default equality method BasicObject#== returns true only if the calling object and the argument are the same object (have the same object id).  This method is typically overriden within classes to fit their class specfic equality test. Most of the time == instance methods are used to test if values are the same, rather than being the same object. The <=> method is often overridden and is invoked within the classes instance method == returning 1, 0, or -1.  0 meaning equal, 1 meaning calling object greater than argument, and -1 meaning argument is greater than the calling object.  If you're looking for object equality use Object#equal?

== instance method typically checks for equality of a value between calling object and argument
equal? instance method typically checks for equality of object (meaning they are the same object_id) and value, between calling object and argument.

----------------------------------------------------------

# ===

The triple equals operator (which is really a method) is used for comparison in case statement, and have different implementation depending on what data type is invoking it. Range#=== implementation essentailly asks 'does the argument fall within the calling range?', where as if String::=== check to see if the argument is a object of the calling objects class.

-----------------------------------------------------------
